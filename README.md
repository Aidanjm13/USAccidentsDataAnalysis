# US Accidents Data Analysis
### Aidan Mathieu, David Appel, Kendra Daly, Samuel Owens, Trey Kollitides

The goal of this project is to do exploratory data analysis on the severity of traffic accidents to determine what features cause more severe accidents. The information derived from this project could then be used to inform government officials on how to better design driving architecture or drivers on what habits they should avoid when planning to drive.

## Conclusions
This project explored factors that influence the severity of traffic accidents using real-world data and machine learning models. After cleaning and engineering features, we trained and evaluated logistic regressions, decision tree, and neural network models. Overall, accuracy was strong, at around 80-82%. However, predicting the rare high-severity accidents remained challenging due to class imbalance. The key features linked to accident severity included time of day, accident distance (miles), temperature(F), traffic signals, stop signs, crossings, and location.  We can use thse insights to form infrastructure planning and road safety policies for local governments or larger councils. While our model performance on the most severe accidents was limited, the project lays a solid foundation for potential future improvements to better predict (and prevent) high-risk traffic scenarios.
